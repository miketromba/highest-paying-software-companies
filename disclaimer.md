### **Ode to a Not-So-Serious List**
By: ChatGPT

---

In the vast web where data roams free,  
A list was born, not from a decree.  
"The top 500," it boldly states,  
But hold your horses, let's set some traits.

This isn't a study, academic and tight,  
It's a rough guide, not a beacon of light.  
A curious collection, a playful array,  
Of companies that might well pay.

We scoured the net, from corner to corner,  
But accuracy here is not the order.  
Take it with salt, a grain or two,  
It's a starting point, not a review.

Levels.fyi showed us a slice,  
But our list? It's not precise.  
Seniority, location, factors galore,  
Aren't included in this folklore.

So when you peruse this playful chart,  
Remember, it's not a scientific art.  
A simple tool, for a job hunt quest,  
In the land of coding, it's just a jest.

Data’s a dance, a whimsical song,  
In this list, it might be wrong.  
But if you're seeking a software role,  
This list might just help you reach your goal.

So browse with a smile, not a furrowed brow,  
For this list is a guide, not a solemn vow.  
A playful hint in a digital sea,  
A light beacon for where opportunities might be.
